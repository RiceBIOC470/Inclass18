% Problem 1. In this directory, you will find the same image of yeast cells as you used
% in homework 5. First preprocess the image any way you like - smoothing, edge detection, etc. 
% Then, try to find as many of the cells as you can using the
% imfindcircles routine with appropriate parameters. 
% Display the image with the circles drawn on it.  

% Problem 2. (A) Draw two sets of 10 random numbers - one from the integers
% between 1 and 9 and the second from the integers between 1 and 10. Run a
% ttest to see if these are significantly different. (B) Repeat this a few
% times with different sets of random numbers to see if you get the same
% result. (C) Repeat (A) and (B) but this time use 100 numbers in each set
% and then 1000 numbers in each set. Comment on the results.
